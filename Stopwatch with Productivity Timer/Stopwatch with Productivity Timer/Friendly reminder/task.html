<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>A notification is a good way to remind your users that the application is there! With this feature, we will make our app more convenient and user-friendly. The user will receive a notification when the stopwatch reaches the upper limit but will still be able to keep working and track the overall elapsed time.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code class="java">NotificationChannel</code> with <code class="java">channelId</code> <code class="java">org.hyperskill</code></li>
<li>Set the notificationChannel importance to <code class="java">IMPORTANCE_HIGH</code></li>
<li>Add an Android notification after the stopwatch reaches the upper limit and the upper limit is greater than 0</li>
<li>Use <code class="java">393939</code> for the notification id</li>
<li>Add some small icon to your notification</li>
<li>Add some title to your notification</li>
<li>Add some text to your notification</li>
<li>Set the notification flags to include the flag only alert once</li>
<li>Set the notification flags to include the flag insistent. You won't be able to do this through the builder. This can be done without unsetting other flags using bitwise or on the current flag with the flag to be added. The notification flags field is a binary number in which each digit represents one flag that is on if 1 or off if 0</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The notification should look as shown in the picture below.</p>
