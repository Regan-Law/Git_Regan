language: English
summary: "<p>Create a useful stopwatch application inspired by the famous Pomodoro\
  \ technique! The main idea is to break one long work period into small intervals\
  \ of work followed by short breaks. In your final application, the user will be\
  \ able to run a stopwatch and set an upper limit. After the limit is reached, the\
  \ app will send the user a notification â€” a reminder to rest.</p><br/><br/>Learn\
